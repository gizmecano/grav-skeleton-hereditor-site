## Background

The _Hereditor_ theme for [Grav](https://github.com/getgrav/grav) is a detached fork of the [_Mediator_ theme](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-mediator) developed by [Grav Team and contributors](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-mediator/graphs/contributors), which was a port of the [_Mediator_ theme](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator) for [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) designed by [Dirk Fabisch](https://twitter.com/dirkfabisch), which in turn was inspired by the [_Readium_ theme](https://github.com/starburst1977/readium) for [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) elaborated by [Sven Read](https://twitter.com/starburst1977).
